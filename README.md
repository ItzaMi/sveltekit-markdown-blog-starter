# SvelteKit Markdown Blog Starter

Welcome to this SvelteKit Markdown blog starter!

With it, you get the barebones for you to create your own blog website using Svelte and Markdown (powered by powered by [mdsvex](https://github.com/pngwn/MDsveX)) ðŸŽ‰

## How can I create a blog entry?

You can easily create any blog post by creating a new entry inside `src/blog` with the `.svx` extension. The best part of it? It's not just regular Markdown, it's MDX! So you'll be able to import any component that you create!

## How do I change the theme for my `code blocks`?

See the `__layout.svelte` inside `src/blog`? There's you'll find a `script` tag importing a `PrismJS` theme (which is handled by the [prism-themes](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes) dependency). You can change the theme by simply changing for the name of another theme! ðŸ˜„

## What to do if I have any further questions?

If you're stuck with anything, please create an issue here or you can contact me directly via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HeyItzaMi)!

Have fun! ðŸ¤˜
